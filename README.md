# BOT-TWITTER
cr√©ation d'un bot twitter

The idea is to fetch the most recents tweets of a users, and like them.

First we create a list of users that we want to fetch and iterate this list wich the "each do" method to apply it on all the data of the list.

Then, we create a variable which take all the last 20 tweets of a user by using the " client.user_timeline" applied to the data. ( its a pre defined method founded on the web)

To finish, we apply the "client.favorite" method which like the list defined in the variable.
